2. Click **"Mark"** on 3-5 tasks you feel ready to work on
3. Marked tasks appear at the top

- Click the sun/moon icon to change themes
- **Try different view modes**: Click List/Board/Calendar buttons to switch views
  - **Board View**: Drag tasks between columns (requires columns to be set up)
  - **Calendar View**: See tasks by due date on a calendar

## Common Workflows

### Sharing Projects
**Want to share a project with someone?**
1. Open the project you want to share
2. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar (e.g., `https://your-app.com/?project=abc-123`)
3. Share the URL via email, chat, or any other method
4. The recipient can open the URL to view the same project (if they have access to your deployed app)

**Note:** Since data is stored locally, sharing a URL only works if:
- You're both using the same deployed instance, OR
- You export your data and they import it on their device

### Daily Review (DIT)
**Morning:**
1. Open the app
2. Review "Today" tasks (yesterday's incomplete tasks rolled over)
3. **Drag 2-3 tasks** from "Tomorrow" to "Today" if you have capacity (or use arrow buttons)
4. Start working from the top

**Evening:**
1. Check off completed tasks
2. Review "Tomorrow" list
3. Add any new tasks (they go to "Tomorrow" automatically)

**Pro tip:** When sections have more than 10 tasks, they become scrollable for easier navigation.

### Focus Session (AF4)
1. Review your unmarked tasks
2. Mark 5-7 tasks you feel ready to tackle
3. Set a timer for 25 minutes (Pomodoro)
4. Work through marked tasks in order
5. Take a break, then repeat

### Weekly Planning (FVP)
1. Add all tasks for the week
2. Click "Start Selection"
3. Go through the comparison process (5-10 minutes)
4. Work through dotted tasks throughout the week
5. Reset and re-prioritize mid-week if needed

## Tips for Success

### Getting Started
- ✅ Start with 5-10 tasks to learn the system
- ✅ Try each time management system for a few days
- ✅ Use the search and filters to find tasks quickly
- ✅ Export your data weekly as a backup
- ✅ **Bookmark project URLs** for quick access to frequently used projects
- ✅ **Use browser back/forward buttons** to navigate between projects

### Task Management
- ✅ Keep task descriptions short and actionable
- ✅ Use tags to categorize (e.g., #urgent, #email, #meeting)
- ✅ Set due dates only for tasks with real deadlines
- ✅ Break large tasks into subtasks

### Time Management Systems
- ✅ **DIT**: Be realistic about "Today" capacity (5-8 tasks max)
- ✅ **AF4**: Mark tasks you genuinely feel ready to do
- ✅ **FVP**: Answer quickly - trust your gut
- ✅ **None**: Use when you need maximum flexibility

### Avoiding Common Mistakes
- ❌ Don't add too many tasks at once (start small)
- ❌ Don't switch systems daily (give each one a week)
- ❌ Don't mark/dot everything (defeats the purpose)
- ❌ Don't forget to export your data regularly

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, the app uses mouse/touch interactions. Keyboard shortcuts may be added in future versions.

### Common Questions

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: Locally in your browser's localStorage. No data leaves your device.

**Q: Can I use this on multiple devices?**
A: Yes! Export your data on one device, then import it on another. Each device stores data locally.

**Q: Can I bookmark specific projects?**
A: Yes! Each project has its own URL (e.g., `/?project=abc-123`). Bookmark the URL to jump directly to that project.

**Q: Do browser back/forward buttons work?**
A: Yes! You can use browser navigation to move between projects and the project list.

**Q: What happens if I clear my browser data?**
A: Your tasks will be lost. Export regularly to backup.

**Q: Can I switch between time management systems?**
A: Yes! Your tasks remain unchanged, only the organization changes.

**Q: How do I backup my data?**
A: Click "Data" → "Export Data" in the header. Save the JSON file.
